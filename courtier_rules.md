Courtier Rules
==============
These rules are based on those created and [published by Mike Kelly (a.k.a. - Ris'sa)](http://dhost.info/rissa/Holochess) (accessed 2015-05-25). The rules are presented as though taken from within universe, and thus there are very few insights into the development process or reasons for certain rules decisions. These are the rules for the simpler game on this site, Courtier. Alterations have been made for the sake of clarity.

Players
-------
2

Equipment
---------
### Game Board
A checkered circular board of two rings each of twelve spaces and a single center space - for a total of 25 spaces - is available. This is the standard configuration as seen in the holochess scene aboard the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope.

### Pieces
There are 6 pieces, 5 guard and 1 king, in each of two colors (such as red and blue).

Objective
---------
To capture the opponent's king.

Setup
-----
Each player is assigned a color by agreement.

The left-most space of the outer ring on each player's side of the board should be black.

Each player places the 6 pieces of their color on each of the spaces in the outer ring on their side of the board. The king is placed on the third space from the right (a white space). It is suggested that players play two games where each player is given the opportunity to make the first move.

Turn
----
A player may move one piece one space on their turn. The move must be to an unoccupied adjacent space, though not diagonally.

If the move results in any piece being directly between two pieces of the opposing color (not diagonally), the middle piece is captured and removed from the board. If multiple pieces are placed into capture positions, all such captured pieces are removed.

Scoring
-------
There is no score kept for this game, and captured pieces do not count for points. However, it is recommended that both players be given an opportunity to make the first move, and thus score may be kept across multiple games.

Winning
-------
The player who captures their opponent's king is the winner.
