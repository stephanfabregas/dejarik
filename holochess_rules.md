Holochess Rules
===============
These rules are based on those created and published by Mike Kelly (a.k.a. - Ris'sa) (accessed 2015-05-19). The rules are presented as though taken from within universe, and thus there are very few insights into the development process or reasons for certain rules decisions. These are the most prevalent rules found when searching for information on holochess and dejarik. However, other than the incorporation of the board and various pawns, this game lacks any real connection to the game as seen in the film.

Alterations in the rules have been made for the sake of simplicity and playability.

### Game Board

A checkered circular board of two rings each of twelve spaces and a single center space - for a total of 25 spaces - is available. This is the standard configuration as seen in the holochess scene aboard the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope.

### Pawns

There are 8 pawns, each with 3 defining metrics: 1) an attack rating, 2) a defense rating, and 3) a movement rating.
