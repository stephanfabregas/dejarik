Holochess Rules
===============
These rules are based on those created and [published by Mike Kelly (a.k.a. - Ris'sa)](http://dhost.info/rissa/Holochess) (accessed 2015-05-25). The rules are presented as though taken from within universe, and thus there are very few insights into the development process or reasons for certain rules decisions. These are the most prevalent rules found when searching for information on holochess and dejarik. However, other than the incorporation of the board and various pawns, this game lacks any real connection to the game as seen in the film. Also, the rules leave room for improvement. Rather substantial alterations have been made for the sake of simplicity, clarity, and playability.

Players

Equipment

### Game Board

A checkered circular board of two rings each of twelve spaces and a single center space - for a total of 25 spaces - is available. This is the standard configuration as seen in the holochess scene aboard the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope.

### Pawns

There are 8 pawns, 4 for each player, each with 3 defining metrics: 1) an attack rating, 2) a defense rating, and 3) a movement rating:

Group 1:
1.  Strong: Attack 5, Defense 5, Movement 2 - The Mantellian Savrip [Kalhar Monster]
2.    Weak: Attack 3, Defense 3, Movement 2 - The Ghhhk
3. Defense: Attack 2, Defense 6, Movement 1 - The Ng'ok [War Beasts]
4.  Attack: Attack 6, Defense 1, Movement 3 - Grimtaash The Molator

Group 2:
1.  Strong: Attack 5, Defense 4, Movement 3 - The M'onnok
2.    Weak: Attack 4, Defense 3, Movement 1 - The Houjix
3. Defense: Attack 1, Defense 6, Movement 2 - The Kintan Strider
4.  Attack: Attack 6, Defense 2, Movement 2 - The K'lor'slug

### Die
One standard 6-sided die is required to determine the outcome of attacks.

Objective
---------
To kill all of your opponent's pawns.

Setup
-----
Each player is assigned a group of pawns by agreement.

The left-most space of the outer ring on each player's side of the board should be black.

The four pawns for each player are placed on the four middle spaces of the outer ring. Players may select which of their pawns start on each of these spaces. Once the pawns are all in place, players agree to who takes the first turn. This can be done by flipping a coin.

Turn
----
A player must take two actions per turn, if possible. Each action may be either a move or an attack, as described below. If there are only two pawns remaining, one for each player, then a final showdown is done instead of the normal turns.

### Moving
A legal move requires that a pawn move the full number of spaces according to its movement rating. Each move is made to an adjacent space either along the same ring or to another ring, but not diagonally - which would require two moves. pawns may not jump over to skip pawns in their path and only one pawn may occupy on space at a time. When moving through the center space, a pawn must move in the same direction from which it started, unless the pawns began its journey in the center space - otherwise a pawn could arbitrarily move to any space in the middle ring by passing through the center space.

### Attacking
A pawn may attack another pawn if they are directly adjacent to one another (not diagonally). There are four possible outcomes of an attack: 1) Attacker Kills, 2) Attacker Pushes, 3) Defender Pushes, 4) Defender Kills. The outcome is determined by the attacking pawn's attack rating, the defending pawn's defense rating, and a 6-sided die roll, as in the scoring section, below.

If a pawn is killed, it is removed from the board. If a pawn is pushed, the winning player may place the losing pawn to any open adjacent space. If there is no open adjacent space, the losing pawn is instead killed.

### Final Showdown
If there are only two pawns remaining, one for each player, play proceeds to a final showdown. Each player rolls the die once, and adds the value of the roll to their pawn's highest rating (either attack or defense). The pawn with the resulting higher score wins. If the resulting score is a tie, another final showdown takes place.

Scoring
-------
During an attack, the outcome is determined by the following rules:

- The attacker rolls the die
- The attacker's score is the top number on the die (the standard result of a die roll) plus the attacking pawn's attack rating
- The defender's score is the bottom number on the die (this is always seven minus the top number on the die) plus the defending pawn's defense rating
- A roll of 6 always results in the attacker killing the defender
- A roll of 1 always results in the defender killing the attacker
- Otherwise, if the attacker's score is greater than the defender's score, the attacker pushes the defender
- If the attacker's score is less than or equal to the defender's score, the defender pushes the attacker

During a final showdown, each players rolls the die once, and adds that value to their pawn's highest rating (attack or defense). The higher score wins, and ties result in another final showdown.

Note that, in all cases, it is possible for the lower value attacking/defending pawn to win a confrontation - even when values appear to be very mismatched - but odds do favor the higher rated pawn.

Winning
-------
The player who kills all of their opponent's pawns is the winner.
