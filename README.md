Dejarik Board
=============

This is a game board for the holoboard games, such as the holochess game commonly called [Dejarik](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dejarik), as seen in Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope.

Both .svg (made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)) and printable .pdf versions are available.

Standard size Checker game pieces(~1.5-inch diameter) are intended to fit this board, but any set of appropriately sized pieces distinguishable designs will do.

See the rules for Dejarik, based on those created by [Igor Barzilai](zeelay.free.fr/star-wars-artisanal/dejarik/regle1.htm), and for Holochess/Dejarik and Courtier, based on those created by [Mike Kelly](http://dhost.info/rissa/Holochess), for more details on equipment and game play.
