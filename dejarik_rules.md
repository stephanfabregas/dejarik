Dejarik Rules
===============
These rules are based on those created and [published by Igor Barzilai](zeelay.free.fr/star-wars-artisanal/dejarik/regle1.htm) (accessed 2015-05-18). The rules are apparently based on the actual moves observed in the relevant scene from Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope. Other rules for a game of the same name have been presented elsewhere, but the effort to tie-in the actual observed moves from the film sets these rules apart.

Players 
-------
2

Equipment
---------
### Game Board

A checkered circular board of two rings each of twelve spaces and a single center space - for a total of 25 spaces - is available. This is the standard configuration as seen in the holochess scene aboard the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope.

### Pawns

Any 2 distinguishable sets of 4 pieces may be used as the pawns for this game. Standard 1.5-inch checkers (red and white, or red and black, for example) will do. Unfortunately, figurines of the pawns shown in the original film are not currently publicly available.

Objective
---------
To be the player to score the most points.

Setup
-----
Each player is assigned control of a pawn color by agreement.

The player in control of the black pawns places three pawns on the three left-most adjacent spaces on the outer ring, and the fourth pawn on the 5th space from the left - the second space from the right - also on the outer ring on that player's side of the board.

Similarly, the player in control of the white pawns places three pawns on the three right-most adjacent spaces on the outer ring, and the fourth pawn on the 5th space form the right - the second space from the left - also on the outer ring on that player's side of the board.

Thus, each player's pawns are aligned directly opposed to each other at the start of the game.

Turn
----
The player in control of the black pawns makes the first move.

There are eight possible legal moves available to each player. Moves are not legal if there are any pawns of either color in the path of movement.

1. Dejarik - a pawn in the outer ring may be moved to the center space. Both the center space and the intervening space in the inner ring must not be occupied
2. Reverse Dejarik - a pawn in the center space may be moved to the outer ring. Both the space in the outer ring and the intervening space in the inner ring must not be occupied
3. Straight Exit - a pawn in the outer ring may be moved to the adjacent space in the inner ring if that space is not occupied
4. Diagonal Exit - a pawn in the outer ring may be moved one space to the left or right of the adjacent space in the inner ring. Both the adjacent space and the space to the left or right on the inner ring must not be occupied
5. Double Diagonal Exit - a pawn in the outer ring may be moved two spaces to the left or right of the adjacent space in the inner ring. However, the space to the left or right of the original space, the adjacent space in the inner ring, and the space to the left or right of that adjacent space must all be unoccupied
6. Boosted Exit - if on a diagonal or double diagonal exit the pawn placed into the inner ring is adjacent to a pawn in the outer ring controlled by the same player, if possible, the pawn making the exit must move two additional spaces to the left or right (in the same direction as the original exit). If the moved pawn is again adjacent to a pawn controlled by the same player in the outer ring, another boost, if possible, is made, and so on. A boost is not possible if either of the two spaces along the path of the boost are occupied, including in the case of a capture
7. Home - a pawn in the inner ring may be moved to the adjacent space in the outer ring if that space is unoccupied. Note, this is the only move available to a pawn in the inner ring
8. Capture - if on a diagonal or double diagonal exit (even after any boost), the moved pawn is next to a pawn controlled by the opponent, also in the inner ring, the opponent's pawn is removed from the board

A player may make one move on their turn. If no legal moves are available, the player forfeits their turn.

Scoring
-------
There are three possible ways to score points:

1. To have four adjacent pawns in the middle row - this is worth 3 points
2. To have three adjacent pawns in the middle row - this is worth 1 point
3. To capture two pawns from your opponent - this is worth 2 points

Once one of these conditions is met, the game is over.

A draw may be declared under two conditions. In these cases, no points are earned.

1. Both players forfeit their turns consecutively because no legal moves are available
2. If repeated moves result in the same board position at least 3 times, either play may declare the game a draw

Winning
-------
Players must agree to winning conditions. For instance, players may agree to play multiple games until one player has reached 12 points. Alternatively, players may agree to play one game at a time and pay stakes equal to the number of points won.
